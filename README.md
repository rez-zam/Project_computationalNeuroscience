# Project-Computational-Neuroscience
This repository is about project of computational neuroscience 

## 1.Problem statement
The goal of this project is to investigate the neural mechanisms of visual information processing in the primate brain, specifically focusing on the V1 (primary visual cortex) and V4 (extrastriate visual cortex) regions of the macaque monkey. We aim to understand how visual information is encoded and processed at different levels of the visual system, with a particular emphasis on the crowding phenomenon and neuronal response variability.

## 2.Related works
Previous studies have explored visual processing in primates, including:
Research on the hierarchical organization of the visual cortex
Studies on the effects of crowding in visual perception
Investigations into neuronal response variability in different visual areas
Comparative analyses of V1 and V4 responses to visual stimuli

## 3.Proposed Method
We propose to use advanced electrophysiological recording techniques to simultaneously record neuronal activity in V1 and V4 regions while presenting carefully designed visual stimuli. The experiment will manipulate variables such as stimulus orientation, target-distractor distance, and contrast to comprehensively examine visual processing.

## 4.Implementation

### 4.1. Dataset
Source: Electrophysiological recordings from macaque monkey visual cortex (V1 and V4)
Task: Visual stimulus presentation with varying conditions (orientation, crowding, contrast)
Channels: Multiple electrode recordings from V1 and V4 regions
Number of trials: To be determined based on experimental design and statistical power requirements

### 4.2. Model
We will develop computational models to analyze and interpret the recorded neuronal data. These may include:

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to characterize neuronal responses
Population coding models to understand information representation across neuronal populations
Hierarchical models to compare processing in V1 and V4

### 4.3. Evaluate
Evaluation methods will include:

Analysis of neuronal firing rates and patterns using Raster Plots
Calculation of neuronal response variability metrics (e.g., Fano factor, Coefficient of Variation)
Statistical comparisons of V1 and V4 responses under different stimulus conditions
Assessment of model performance in predicting neuronal responses
Quantification of information content in neuronal responses using information theory metrics

These evaluations will help us understand the differences in visual information processing between V1 and V4, the effects of crowding on neuronal responses, and the nature of neuronal variability in these visual areas.
